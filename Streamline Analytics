Here's a structured approach to perform the tasks for the Netflix Movies & TV Shows Dataset - 
Following tasks are categorized into 3 files depending on the complexity level -
- SA_Part_A
- SA_Part_B
- SA_Part_C

1.	Data Cleaning and Preprocessing -
o	Handle missing values (e.g., genre, director).
o	Convert date columns into proper datetime format.
o	Filter dataset by specific attributes such as region, type of show (movie/TV), etc.

2.	Descriptive Statistics -
o	Calculate summary statistics (mean, median, mode, etc.) for numerical columns like release year and duration.
o	Find the distribution of movies vs. TV shows in the dataset.

3.	Data Visualization -
o	Create bar charts, histograms, and pie charts to visualize the distribution of genres, countries, and types (movies vs. TV shows).
o	Use box plots to explore the duration of movies and TV shows.

4.	Trend Analysis -
o	Analyze how the number of shows/movies added to Netflix has changed over time.
o	Identify the most popular release years and genres by country.
o	Visualize the top genres of content over time.

5.	Time Series Analysis -
o	Perform a time series analysis to find trends in content production and release frequency by month or year.

6.	Segmentation and Clustering -
o	Segment the dataset based on genres, countries, or types of content.
o	Cluster similar types of shows/movies based on their attributes (e.g., duration, genre, etc.) using clustering techniques like K-Means.

7.	Correlation and Feature Engineering -
o	Explore relationships between variables (e.g., correlation between release year and duration).
o	Create new features such as "Content Age" (the difference between release year and current year) or "Is New Release" (binary feature for recent content).

8.	Advanced Visualizations -
o	Create heatmaps for correlations between features.
o	Use geographic visualizations (maps) to show the distribution of content by country.

9.	Predictive Modeling -
o	Build a classification model to predict the type of content (Movie vs. TV Show) based on other features such as duration, release year, and genre.
o	Apply machine learning models (e.g., decision trees, logistic regression) to predict content trends or popular genres in upcoming years.

10.	Recommendation System -
•	Building a recommendation system involves suggesting items to users based on their preferences or behavior. For the Netflix Movies & TV Shows dataset, we can build a content-based recommendation system or a collaborative filtering recommendation system.

10.1] CONTENT BASED RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM :
• A content-based recommendation system suggests items similar to those a user has liked based on features of the items. For the Netflix dataset, we can use features like genre, rating, and duration to recommend similar shows or movies.
Step 1: Import Libraries and Load the Dataset
Python Code
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import linear_kernel
import re

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('netflix_titles.csv')

# Display the first few rows
df.head()

Step 2: Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
We need to prepare the data by combining relevant features and processing text data for similarity calculations.
Python Code
# Fill missing values in 'listed_in'
df['listed_in'] = df['listed_in'].fillna('')

# Combine 'listed_in' (genres) and 'description' into a single text feature
df['content'] = df['listed_in'] + ' ' + df['description']

# Clean and preprocess the text
df['content'] = df['content'].apply(lambda x: re.sub(r'\s+', ' ', x.lower()))  # Remove extra spaces and convert to lowercase

# Create a TF-IDF Vectorizer
tfidf_vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english')
tfidf_matrix = tfidf_vectorizer.fit_transform(df['content'])

Step 3: Compute Similarity Scores
Calculate the cosine similarity between items based on their content.
Python Code
# Compute cosine similarity
cosine_sim = linear_kernel(tfidf_matrix, tfidf_matrix)

# Create a DataFrame to hold the similarity scores
cosine_sim_df = pd.DataFrame(cosine_sim, index=df['title'], columns=df['title'])

Step 4: Define a Function to Get Recommendations
Create a function that recommends similar movies or shows based on a given title.
Python Code
def recommend(title, cosine_sim_df, top_n=10):
    # Get pairwise similarity scores for the given title
    sim_scores = cosine_sim_df[title]
    
    # Sort the movies or shows based on similarity scores
    sim_scores = sim_scores.sort_values(ascending=False)
    
    # Get the top N most similar items
    top_titles = sim_scores.index[1:top_n+1]  # Exclude the first one as it's the same title
    return top_titles

# Example usage
recommendations = recommend('The Dark Knight', cosine_sim_df)
print('Recommended Titles:')
print(recommendations)

10.2] COLLABORATIVE FILTERING RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM :
• Collaborative filtering recommends items based on user interactions (e.g., ratings). Since our dataset doesn't include user ratings or interactions, we would need additional data for this approach. However, if you had a user-item matrix, you could use the following approach:
Step 1: Import Libraries and Load User-Item Interaction Data
Python Code
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

# Example user-item matrix
# user_item_matrix = pd.read_csv('user_item_matrix.csv')  # This would be your user-item interaction matrix

Step 2: Compute Similarities
Calculate similarities between users or items based on interactions.
Python Code
# Compute similarity matrix
similarity_matrix = cosine_similarity(user_item_matrix)

# Create a DataFrame to hold the similarity scores
similarity_df = pd.DataFrame(similarity_matrix, index=user_item_matrix.index, columns=user_item_matrix.index)

Step 3: Define a Function to Get Recommendations
Create a function that recommends items based on user similarity scores.
Python Code
def get_recommendations(user_id, similarity_df, user_item_matrix, top_n=10):
    # Get similar users
    sim_scores = similarity_df[user_id]
    
    # Sort the users based on similarity scores
    sim_scores = sim_scores.sort_values(ascending=False)
    
    # Get top N similar users
    top_users = sim_scores.index[1:top_n+1]
    
    # Aggregate the items liked by similar users
    similar_users_items = user_item_matrix.loc[top_users].mean()
    
    # Recommend items not yet interacted with by the user
    user_items = user_item_matrix.loc[user_id]
    recommendations = similar_users_items[user_items == 0].sort_values(ascending=False)
    
    return recommendations.index[:top_n]

# Example usage (assuming user_item_matrix and similarity_df are defined)
# recommendations = get_recommendations('user_1', similarity_df, user_item_matrix)
# print('Recommended Items:')
# print(recommendations)
Summary
1.	Content-Based Recommendation System:
o	Combined content features (genres, description).
o	Used TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to recommend similar items.
2.	Collaborative Filtering Recommendation System:
o	Needed user-item interaction data (e.g., ratings).
o	Used user or item similarity to recommend items based on similar users' preferences.
Since we don't have user interactions in this dataset, the content-based approach is the most feasible for recommendations based on the available data. If you had additional user interaction data, collaborative filtering would be a powerful addition.
